My preferred topics are:

1) Digital Divide. Serving a population who is usually lacking in digital services, which, now teaching 
remotely had become a very complex issue which had to be addressed by admin, teachers
and the DOE, as well as donnors, I am very interested in this topic.  Can we provide enough internet and 
computing power to all americans?

2) Net neutrality.  While it is hard to argue against companies wantng to give better
service to their customers, I much prefer the "old ways" - pretty recent actually - of net neutrality.  
There is a Vint Cert video which we used in AP CSP where he specifically talks about Net neutrality.
He specifically defends this property and encourages the audience to rally behind it.  His perspective
is that the internet is really an idea, a concept, about de-centralizing data and 
services and that net neutrality is a basic part of that concept. While he does not specifically mention it,
he seems to imply that without it, the internet is no longer the internet, certanly,
not the same internet.

3) AI Bias - This is really my number one topic, I am just not sure how I would include code in this. 
(Actually on neither, really).  I find the bias in AI is one of the most important issues we need to
present to our students, they will be the codesrs of the future and having them be aware and be able to 
address it is the best.  The main problem I see is that, at least for NNs, the problem is rarely in the algorith 
itself, but mostly in the data provided.

Any of the above would be great for me!
